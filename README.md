# This is README File for the Samsung Tidy Data set Course Project.

This Github repository (https://github.com/bheeke/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project.git) contains:

1. README.md - file explaining the nature of each file in the repository

2. CodeBook.md - file containing any special processing instructions/pre-requisites, metadata about the source files, and the required variables and transformations needed to produce the tidy data set.

3. CodeBook.xlsx - file containing just the required variables on the tidy data set and their respective definitions. This is used as a data source to rename variables to a cleaner, tidy convention.

3. The script 'run_analysis.R' that will collect and process the source files and CodeBook metadata needed to produce the tidy data set.

4. The final, tidy data set 'analysis_final.csv' - final data set where all mean and standard deviation variables are averaged by activity and subject
